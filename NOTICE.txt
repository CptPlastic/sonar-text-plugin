Initially developed by Gordon J. Daugherty in Aug 2015. Please enjoy and contribute!

This was modelled after and uses some code from both the sample sonar plugin that Sonarqube provides and the Sonarqube XML Plugin
project that was initially developed by Matthijs Galesloot. Thanks go to Sonarqube and Mr Galesloot for licensing those in such a
way that they can be used by others to expand this ecosystem.
